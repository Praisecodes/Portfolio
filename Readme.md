## New Portfolio Design and Total Overhauling

I decided to create this new portfolio for two reasons
1. The old one looks TERRIBLE
2. The old one had no cool animations and I so much want to include that in my portfolio
3. The old one was literally a copy paste design from a friends who's portfolio was 10x better than that.
4. I got a portfolio review on Twitter that pointed out a whole lot to change on the previous portfolio.

So with the fact that I'm just learning JavaScript and getting into the whole thing, I decided to re-build my entire portfolio.
